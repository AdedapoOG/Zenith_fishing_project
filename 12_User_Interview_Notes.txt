   - "I received the email and it looked like a real IT message. I clicked on the link and typed my password. Nothing happened, so I thought the system was down."

2. User: asmith
   - "I didn’t click the link because I noticed the sender’s address seemed off. I reported it to IT."

3. User: jsmith
   - "I opened the email on my phone. I didn't click the link but forwarded it to a colleague."
